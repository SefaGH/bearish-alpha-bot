# KuCoin API Data Fetching Fix - Summary

## Problem Description (Turkish)
KuCoin API anahtarları ve izinleri doğru şekilde eklenmiş olmasına rağmen, GitHub Actions üzerinden çalışan backtest workflow'unda (param_sweep.py dosyası), KuCoin'den hiç veri gelmiyor ve herhangi bir hata mesajı da alınmıyor. Credentials debug adımında anahtarlar var görünüyor, fakat veri çekme işlemi başarısız oluyor.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Silent Failures Due to Poor Error Handling
- Backtest scripts (`param_sweep.py` and `param_sweep_str.py`) had NO logging configured
- Critical operations were not wrapped in try-except blocks
- When errors occurred, scripts would exit silently without any error messages

### 2. SystemExit Swallowing Errors
- `validate_and_get_symbol()` in `ccxt_client.py` was converting ALL exceptions to `SystemExit`
- `SystemExit` is a `BaseException`, not an `Exception`, so it bypasses normal exception handling
- When `SystemExit` is raised, Python exits immediately without stack traces
- In GitHub Actions, this appears as a silent failure with no error output

### 3. No Visibility into API Calls
- CCXT library errors were not being logged
- No debug information about what credentials were being used
- No logging of retry attempts or API call failures
- Impossible to diagnose authentication or network issues

### 4. Missing Error Context
- When errors did occur, they lacked actionable information
- No guidance on which environment variables were missing or incorrect
- No distinction between authentication errors vs. other API failures

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Logging System
**File: `src/backtest/param_sweep.py` and `src/backtest/param_sweep_str.py`**

Added logging configuration:
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=os.getenv('LOG_LEVEL', 'INFO'),
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Benefits:
- All operations are now logged
- Respects `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable for debugging
- Errors go to stderr (visible in GitHub Actions)
- Progress tracking shows what step failed

### 2. Proper Exception Handling
**File: `src/core/ccxt_client.py`**

Changed from `SystemExit` to `RuntimeError`:
```python
# Before (BAD):
raise SystemExit(f"Symbol validation failed: {e}")

# After (GOOD):
raise RuntimeError(error_msg) from e
```

Added detailed error logging:
```python
logger.error(f"Failed to load markets for {self.name}: {type(e).__name__}: {e}")
logger.error(f"⚠️ AUTHENTICATION ERROR: Please verify your {self.name.upper()} API credentials")
```

Benefits:
- Errors are properly caught and logged
- Stack traces are preserved for debugging
- Clear distinction between error types
- Actionable error messages

### 3. Try-Catch Blocks Around Critical Operations
**File: `src/backtest/param_sweep.py` and `param_sweep_str.py`**

Wrapped each critical step:
```python
try:
    logger.info("Building exchange clients from environment...")
    clients = build_clients_from_env()
    logger.info(f"Available exchanges: {list(clients.keys())}")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"❌ Failed to build exchange clients: {type(e).__name__}: {e}")
    logger.error("Please check that EXCHANGES environment variable is set and credentials are valid")
    raise SystemExit(1) from e
```

Benefits:
- Each failure point has specific error message
- Logs show exactly which step failed
- Context information (exchange name, symbol, etc.) included
- Exits with code 1 so GitHub Actions marks as failed

### 4. Enhanced Credential Debugging
**File: `src/core/multi_exchange.py`**

Added debug logging for credentials:
```python
logger.debug(f"Loading credentials for {name}: using KUCOIN_* or {up}_* environment variables")
logger.debug(f"Credentials found for {name}: KEY={'✓' if key else '✗'}, SECRET={'✓' if sec else '✗'}, PASSWORD={'✓' if pwd else '✗'}")
```

Benefits:
- Shows which environment variables are being checked
- Indicates presence/absence of credentials
- Helps diagnose credential configuration issues
- Works with LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

### 5. Improved KuCoin Support
**Files: `src/core/multi_exchange.py` and `src/core/ccxt_client.py`**

- Added 'kucoin' (spot) to supported exchanges
- Both 'kucoin' and 'kucoinfutures' can share KUCOIN_* credentials
- Special error messages for KuCoin authentication

Benefits:
- More flexible credential configuration
- Clear guidance on which credentials to use
- Supports both spot and futures with same credentials

## Testing

### Test Coverage
1. **test_symbol_validation.py** - Updated to expect RuntimeError instead of SystemExit ✅
2. **test_backtest_error_handling.py** - New comprehensive test suite ✅
3. **smoke_test.py** - All imports and basic functionality ✅

All tests passing!

### Manual Testing with Invalid Credentials
```bash
export EXCHANGES=kucoinfutures
export KUCOIN_KEY=invalid
export KUCOIN_SECRET=invalid
export KUCOIN_PASSWORD=invalid
python src/backtest/param_sweep.py
```

Output now shows:
```
ERROR - ❌ Symbol validation failed: RuntimeError: Symbol validation failed for kucoinfutures
ERROR - ⚠️ AUTHENTICATION ERROR: Please verify your KUCOINFUTURES API credentials are correct
ERROR -    KuCoin Futures can use either KUCOIN_* or KUCOINFUTURES_* credentials
ERROR -    Required: KUCOIN_KEY + KUCOIN_SECRET + KUCOIN_PASSWORD
ERROR -    OR: KUCOINFUTURES_KEY + KUCOINFUTURES_SECRET + KUCOINFUTURES_PASSWORD
```

## Documentation Updates

### TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- Added new section 8.1: "KuCoin API Veri Çekme Sorunları"
- Explains the root causes and fixes
- Shows how to use LOG_LEVEL for debugging
- Provides GitHub Actions debugging steps

### ENV_VARIABLES.md
- Added 'kucoin' to supported exchanges list
- Documented KUCOIN_* credential sharing
- Added example configurations for KuCoin
- Clarified credential requirements

## Usage in GitHub Actions

To enable debug logging in workflows:
```yaml
- name: Run backtest
  env:
    LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG  # Add this for detailed logs
    EXCHANGES: ${{ secrets.EXCHANGES }}
    KUCOIN_KEY: ${{ secrets.KUCOIN_KEY }}
    KUCOIN_SECRET: ${{ secrets.KUCOIN_SECRET }}
    KUCOIN_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.KUCOIN_PASSWORD }}
    # ... other vars
  run: python src/backtest/param_sweep.py
```

## Before vs After

### Before ❌
- Script exits silently with no error message
- GitHub Actions shows "completed" but no results
- No way to diagnose credential or API issues
- User has no idea what went wrong

### After ✅
- Clear error messages logged to stderr
- GitHub Actions shows failed step with error details
- Specific guidance on which credentials are needed
- Easy to diagnose and fix issues
- Debug mode available via LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

## Files Changed

1. `src/core/ccxt_client.py` - Enhanced error handling and logging
2. `src/core/multi_exchange.py` - Improved credential handling
3. `src/backtest/param_sweep.py` - Added logging and error handling
4. `src/backtest/param_sweep_str.py` - Added logging and error handling
5. `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Added KuCoin debugging section
6. `docs/ENV_VARIABLES.md` - Updated with KuCoin documentation
7. `tests/test_symbol_validation.py` - Fixed for RuntimeError
8. `tests/test_backtest_error_handling.py` - New comprehensive test suite

## Conclusion

The issue was NOT a problem with KuCoin API credentials themselves, but rather a problem with **how errors were being handled and reported**. The credentials were likely correct, but when API calls failed (for whatever reason - network, rate limits, authentication, etc.), the errors were silently swallowed, making it impossible to diagnose the issue.

With these fixes:
- All errors are now visible in GitHub Actions logs
- Clear, actionable error messages guide users to the solution
- Debug mode provides detailed insight into what's happening
- The system fails fast and loud rather than failing silently
