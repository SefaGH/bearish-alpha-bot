Validation Script for Signal Execution Fix

This script demonstrates the fix for the signal queue timeout issue.
It creates a minimal test environment and validates that:
1. Signals are added to the queue
2. Queue processing has priority over scanning
3. Timeout is set to 5 seconds
4. Execution counter is tracked
