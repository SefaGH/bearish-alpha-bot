## 📋 **COMPLETE ISSUE LIST**

### **🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY (Must Fix Before Production)**

#### **Issue #126: Fix REST API Method Name**
- **URL:** [#126](https://github.com/SefaGH/bearish-alpha-bot/issues/126)
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Time:** 5 minutes
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Labels:** bug, critical, rest-api, trading-engine

**Problem:**
```
ERROR - REST fetch failed: 'CcxtClient' object has no attribute 'fetch_ohlcv'
Frequency: 90+ times in 5-minute session
Impact: Market scanning broken, no continuous trading
```

**Solution:**
```python
# File: src/core/live_trading_engine.py (~line 100)
# CHANGE:
ohlcv = client.fetch_ohlcv(symbol, timeframe, limit=limit)
# TO:
ohlcv = client.get_ohlcv(symbol, timeframe, limit=limit)
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Zero `fetch_ohlcv` errors in 5-min test
- [ ] Market scan loop completes successfully
- [ ] REST API success rate >95%
- [ ] Continuous signal generation working

---

#### **Issue #128: Fix File Logging**
- **URL:** [#128](https://github.com/SefaGH/bearish-alpha-bot/issues/128)
- **Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Time:** 15 minutes
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Labels:** bug

**Problem:**
```
Log file created: logs/live_trading_20251020_113654.log
File size: 0 bytes (empty)
All logs going to console only
```

**Solution:**
```python
# File: src/utils/logger.py or src/core/logger.py
def setup_file_logging():
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
    log_file = f'logs/live_trading_{timestamp}.log'
    file_handler = logging.FileHandler(log_file, mode='w')
    file_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.addHandler(file_handler)
    return log_file
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Log file created and written
- [ ] File size >0 bytes after session
- [ ] All console logs also in file
- [ ] Proper formatting maintained

### **🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Should Fix This Week)**

#### **Issue #130: Optimize Duplicate Prevention Threshold**
- **URL:** [#130](https://github.com/SefaGH/bearish-alpha-bot/issues/130)
- **Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM
- **Time:** 10 minutes
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Labels:** enhancement, strategy, config

**Problem:**
```
Current threshold: 0.15% (too aggressive)
Signal rejection rate: 50% (5/10 signals rejected)
Actual price changes: 0.01-0.06%
Cooldown: 27-28 seconds
Result: Missed profitable trades
```

**Solution:**
```yaml
# File: config/config.example.yaml
signals:
  duplicate_prevention:
    min_price_change_pct: 0.05  # CHANGE: 0.15 → 0.05
    cooldown_seconds: 20        # CHANGE: 30 → 20
```

**Expected Improvement:**
```
Signal acceptance rate: 50% → 70-80%
More trades during trending markets
Still prevents spam (0.05% filter)
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Threshold set to 0.05% in config
- [ ] Cooldown set to 20 seconds
- [ ] Signal acceptance rate >70% in 15-min test
- [ ] No duplicate spam trades

---

#### **Issue #133: Debug Multi-Symbol Trading**
- **URL:** [#133](https://github.com/SefaGH/bearish-alpha-bot/issues/133)
- **Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM
- **Time:** 45 minutes
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Labels:** debug, strategy, config

**Problem:**
```
5-minute session results:
- BTC/USDT: 10 signals (5 accepted) ✅
- ETH/USDT: 0 signals ❌
- SOL/USDT: 0 signals ❌

No diversification, missed opportunities
```

**Solution:**
```python
# File: strategies/adaptive_str.py
# Add debug logging:
logger.info(f"[STR-DEBUG] {symbol}")
logger.info(f"  RSI: {current_rsi:.2f} (threshold: {self.adaptive_threshold})")
logger.info(f"  EMA Align: {ema_aligned}")
logger.info(f"  Volume OK: {volume_ok}")
logger.info(f"  ATR: {atr:.4f}")
logger.info(f"  Signal: {signal_action or 'NONE'}")
```

```yaml
# File: config/config.example.yaml
# Add symbol-specific config:
strategies:
  adaptive_str:
    symbols:
      BTC/USDT:USDT:
        rsi_threshold: 55
      ETH/USDT:USDT:
        rsi_threshold: 50  # Lower for ETH
      SOL/USDT:USDT:
        rsi_threshold: 50  # Lower for SOL
```

**Expected Result:**
```
15-minute session after fix:
- BTC: 8-10 signals ✅
- ETH: 3-5 signals ✅
- SOL: 2-4 signals ✅
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Debug logs show all filter checks per symbol
- [ ] ETH/SOL signals generated in 15-min test
- [ ] At least 1 position opened for ETH and SOL
- [ ] Symbol-specific config documented

### **🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)**

#### **Issue #134: Validate Exit Logic**
- **URL:** [#134](https://github.com/SefaGH/bearish-alpha-bot/issues/134)
- **Priority:** 🟢 LOW
- **Time:** 60 minutes
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Labels:** enhancement

**Problem:**
```
5-minute test session:
- 5 positions opened
- 0 positions closed
- No SL/TP/Trailing Stop hits
- Max P&L movement: ±0.2%
- SL/TP levels: ±0.5-1.1%

Result: Exit logic not validated
```

**Solution:**
Run extended sessions and validate exit triggers:
```bash
# 30-minute test:
python scripts/live_trading_launcher.py --paper --duration 1800

# 60-minute test:
python scripts/live_trading_launcher.py --paper --duration 3600
```

**Expected Logs:**
```
🛑 [STOP-LOSS-HIT] pos_BTC_123
   Entry: $110,000 Exit: $109,500 P&L: -$0.50 (-0.45%)

🎯 [TAKE-PROFIT-HIT] pos_BTC_456
   Entry: $110,000 Exit: $111,200 P&L: +$1.20 (+1.09%)

🚦 [TRAILING-STOP-HIT] pos_BTC_789
   Entry: $110,000 Exit: $110,700 P&L: +$0.70 (+0.64%)
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] At least 3 positions exited by SL/TP/trailing stop in 30-min test

#### **Issue #135: WebSocket Performance Logging**
- **URL:** Not yet created (Draft ready)
- **Priority:** 🟢 LOW
- **Time:** 15 minutes
- **Status:** DRAFT
- **Labels:** enhancement

**Problem:**
```
WebSocket stats available but not logged:
- websocket_usage_ratio: 97.8%
- avg_latency_ws: 18.3ms
- avg_latency_rest: 234.7ms
- latency_improvement_pct: 92.2%

No visibility into WS performance during sessions
```

**Solution:**
```python
# File: src/core/live_trading_engine.py
# In strategy execution loop:
if int(time.time()) % 60 == 0:
    self._log_websocket_performance()

def _log_websocket_performance(self):
    stats = self.get_websocket_stats()
    logger.info(
        f"📊 [WS-PERFORMANCE]\n"
        f"   Usage Ratio: {stats['websocket_usage_ratio']:.1f}%\n"
        f"   WS Latency: {stats['avg_latency_ws']:.1f}ms\n"
        f"   REST Latency: {stats['avg_latency_rest']:.1f}ms\n"
        f"   Improvement: {stats['latency_improvement_pct']:.1f}%"
    )
```

**Expected Output (every 60s):**
```
📊 [WS-PERFORMANCE]
   Usage Ratio: 97.8%
   WS Latency: 18.3ms
   REST Latency: 234.7ms
   Improvement: 92.2%
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `[WS-PERFORMANCE]` log appears every 60s
- [ ] All 4 stats included
