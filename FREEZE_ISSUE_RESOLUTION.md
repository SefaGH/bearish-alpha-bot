# Live Trading Bot Freeze Issue - Resolution Summary

## Issue Report
**Title:** Live Trading Bot Freezes or Gets Stuck After Startup (WebSocket/Connection Issue)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**Date:** October 21, 2025

---

## Problem Description

The live trading bot would complete all initialization and pre-flight checks successfully, but would then freeze or become unresponsive during or after startup. No trades were executed, and no error messages or tracebacks were shown in the logs.

### Symptoms
- ‚úÖ All pre-flight checks passed (environment, exchange, risk management, strategies, WebSocket)
- ‚úÖ Bot announced "STARTING LIVE TRADING" 
- ‚ùå No further trading activity or log output
- ‚ùå Bot appeared frozen/unresponsive
- ‚ùå Issue was reproducible across sessions

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug üêõ

**Location:** `src/core/production_coordinator.py`, line 1123

```python
def _fetch_ohlcv(self, client, symbol: str, timeframe: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Helper method to fetch OHLCV data via REST API."""
    try:
        rows = client.ohlcv(symbol, timeframe, limit=200)  # ‚ùå BLOCKING CALL
        return self._ohlcv_to_dataframe(rows)
```

### Why It Froze

1. **Blocking Network I/O:** The `client.ohlcv()` method makes synchronous HTTP requests that can take several seconds
2. **Blocking Retries:** Includes `time.sleep(0.8)` for retry delays (also blocking)
3. **Event Loop Blockage:** When called from async context, it blocks the entire event loop

### Impact Chain

```
process_symbol() [async]
    ‚Üí _fetch_ohlcv() [sync with blocking I/O]
        ‚Üí client.ohlcv() [network call + time.sleep()]
            ‚Üí üîí EVENT LOOP FROZEN
                ‚Üí ‚ùå WebSocket health monitor can't run
                ‚Üí ‚ùå Trading loop can't process other symbols
                ‚Üí ‚ùå All async tasks stopped
                ‚Üí ‚ùå Bot appears "frozen"
```

---

## The Solution

### Fix Applied ‚úÖ

Made `_fetch_ohlcv()` async and used `asyncio.to_thread()` to run blocking calls in a thread pool:

```python
async def _fetch_ohlcv(self, client, symbol: str, timeframe: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Helper method to fetch OHLCV data via REST API.
    
    This method runs the blocking client.ohlcv() call in a thread pool to prevent
    blocking the async event loop, which was causing the bot to freeze.
    """
    try:
        # Run blocking I/O in thread pool to prevent event loop blocking
        rows = await asyncio.to_thread(client.ohlcv, symbol, timeframe, limit=200)
        return self._ohlcv_to_dataframe(rows)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to fetch {symbol} {timeframe}: {e}")
        return None
```

### Additional Improvements

1. **Timeout Protection:** Added 30-second timeout per symbol
2. **Debug Logging:** Loop iteration tracking for better diagnostics
3. **Error Handling:** Better exception handling with timeouts

---

## Testing & Validation

### 1. Unit Tests ‚úÖ
Created comprehensive test suite: `tests/test_async_blocking_fix.py`

- ‚úÖ Test `_fetch_ohlcv` is properly async
- ‚úÖ Test concurrent fetches run in parallel
- ‚úÖ Test timeout protection works
- ‚úÖ Test error handling
- ‚úÖ **All 6 tests passing**

### 2. Validation Demo ‚úÖ
Created visual demonstration: `examples/validate_freeze_fix.py`

**Before Fix:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Notice: Heartbeat stopped for ~1.0s while blocking call ran!
   This is what caused the bot to freeze.
```

**After Fix:**
```
‚úì Notice: Heartbeat continued running during blocking call!
   Event loop remained responsive.
```

### 3. Security Scan ‚úÖ
- **CodeQL Analysis:** 0 vulnerabilities found
- **No security issues introduced**

### 4. Compatibility ‚úÖ
- Python 3.9+ (asyncio.to_thread introduced in 3.9)
- Tested on Python 3.12.3
- All existing tests pass

## Prevention Guidelines

To prevent similar issues in the future:

### ‚ùå Don't Do This
```python
async def async_function():
    result = blocking_call()  # Blocks event loop
    time.sleep(1)             # Blocks event loop
```

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead
```python
async def async_function():
    result = await asyncio.to_thread(blocking_call)  # Non-blocking
    await asyncio.sleep(1)                           # Non-blocking
```

### Checklist for Async Code
- [ ] Never call blocking functions without `asyncio.to_thread()`
- [ ] Always use `await` with async functions
- [ ] Add timeouts to prevent indefinite waiting
- [ ] Use async libraries when available (aiohttp, aiofiles, etc.)
- [ ] Avoid `time.sleep()` - use `asyncio.sleep()` instead

## Results

### Before Fix ‚ùå
- Bot freezes after startup
- No trading activity
- WebSocket health monitor stops
- No error messages
- Manual restart required

### After Fix ‚úÖ
- Bot runs continuously
- Trading loop processes all symbols
- WebSocket health monitor runs in background
- Concurrent operations work
- Event loop remains responsive

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Run Tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_async_blocking_fix.py -v
   ```

2. **Run Validation Demo:**
   ```bash
   python examples/validate_freeze_fix.py
   ```

3. **Start Bot in Paper Mode:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/live_trading_launcher.py --paper --duration 300
   ```
   
   Monitor logs for:
   - Loop iteration messages appearing regularly
   - Symbols being processed continuously
   - No hanging or freezing
